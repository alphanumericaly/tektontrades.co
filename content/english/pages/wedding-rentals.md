# Quality wedding rentals

Having planned (my wife would disagree) a wedding, I too was disgusted with outrageous wedding prices. It's like they charge so much just because they can. If everyone would just stop agreeing to pay so much, then... That's where Tekton Wedding Rentals come into play! 

Celebrate your wedding with rentals that are carefully built and well maintained.

You've got everything but that _one_ thing. Rent it from us and get a free magnetic name tag for your cake stand!

#### Rental for 2 items and a bonus poloriod holder

You need 2 more things for the perfect ceremony and reception... good news! Rent both from Tekton and we'll throw in the bonus cake stand and also a rustic poloriod picture holder. Don't worry, the free name tag is on us as well.

#### Rental for 3 or more items

If you rent 3 or more items, each additional item is only $150 more for the weekend. Both the cake stand and poloriod holders are still included.
