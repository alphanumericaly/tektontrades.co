# Crates

Crating your most valuable posessions just makes sense - a small cost up front for those priceless pieces in your house. Crates make sense for other things too - shipping artwork, for example. 

Our custom sized crates are built professionally for MoveBright Moving & Storage in Jax, but are able to be sourced directly to you. We build crates for everything! Motorcycles, fireplaces, and 12 foot long glass table tops. Everything can be packaged well given it's best chance at headache free transportation with the proper planning.
