# Custom hardwood dowels

Have you ever wished you had a cherry dowel instead of an oak dowel dyed a cherry color? How about walnut? Maple? We make our own custom dowels! All we need to make the dowel of your choice are the wood species, the length and diameter. 

Below are some projects where I needed a dowel that will match the project wood and not stand out as stained. The results were wonderful and completely worth the extra time invested into learning how to use the doweling jig I bought. 

I utilize the Veritas Dowel Maker, which is a 2 blade system that uses a drill to spin square stock into a dowel. No fuss with roundover bits on the router or jigs on your table saw. Dowels may be cut in any length up to about 3 feet. Any longer than that and we run into issues where the wood is not stable enough to get a clean cut.
