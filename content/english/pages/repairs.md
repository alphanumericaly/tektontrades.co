# For that which you can't get rid of...

Wood working is what we do, and helping you out is how we keep well built furniture in homes around the country. Send an email to repairs@tektontrades.co with a picture of your furniture that needs repair, a brief description of what you need, and we will let you know whether or not it's a job we can handle. Repair work can be done as a regularly scheduled job or at a discount if it's something we can do during down time. Repairs will be left to bare wood, so that the owner can decide if they would like to sand and stain or paint the rest of the matching furniture. 

Repairs are a great way to save money!
