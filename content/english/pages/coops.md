# Do you give a cluck about your ladies?

Chickens are awesome. Seroiusly. And because chickens are awesome, I built an awesome chicken coop for them. While I've only built one chicken coop, I think that the work stands for itself. It was built via mortise and tenon joinery. By the very nature of how I chose to construct it, when I started assembling the coop, everything was perfectly square and perfectly level, as soon as each piece was installed. Now, you may think that doesn't matter much for a chicken coop, but you'd be wrong. It makes you proud of your chicken coop. 

The mortise and tenon joinery servers to ensure the chicken coop will last a long time sitting in the elements. I'm not worried about wind blowing and making screws loose because there was water penetration to rot the wood around the screw. I'm really not worried about anything with that chicken coop. It's rock solid, and your coop and peace of mind can't get much better than that. Having hens myself, I did an unreasonable amount of research on the best practices.

Our coop features an automatic chicken run door, that runs off solar power. It opens just before sunrise and shuts just after sunset, so we don't have to worry about letting the chickens into the run and locking them up at night. I installed automatic watering buckets as well. Did you know that one single chicken can drink up to 32 ounces of water in one day during the summer? That's why there is an automatic watering bucket in our coop. That's a lot of water! We've also got a Grandpas Feeder, which is an automatic pest proof chicken feeder, which we fill once a week. 

Our coop has a real shingle roof, though material can vary due to price, desired look, or material available on hand. It's withstood several of the minor hurricanes and windstorms that we've had here in Jax in the recent years, and we've had no issues with it. Additionally, and perhaps as a footnote, the coop was built on "temporary" footers. It's not concreted into the ground, thus negating the need for a building permit. In fact, the coop sits on top of the ground, and could be moved if needed. 

I can build any coop design, and meet any coop needs (almost assuredly).
