# Hardwood picture frames  
Frames can be notorious for falling apart, especially when you get into things like Hobby Lobby or TJ Maxx frames. Yes, they're cheap, and we do appreciate that... but is it really worth it? When Tekton does frames, the joints are reinforced for maximum strength while remaining visually appealing. 

Through different types of layering, we can achieve stunning frame looks that seem to be one piece of wood that will leave your guests wondering how the frame was built in that manner. 

The benefits of custom frames are of course specialty sized photos and diplomas, but also the repeatability. All of the frames on your picture wall can be the same, similar, or match the same feel.
