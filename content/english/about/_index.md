Jake is a new father to a young son, a husband to Tektons co-owner Mikal, and otherwise a reasonably good guy. I've got 12 chickens, thought the city wouldn't like that. I live in Jacksonville, Florida, and don't really care for the weather here. I decided to start my own business because I love to build. Imagine that? The guy you're looking to hire to build, wanted to build his own _thing_. I began building somewhere around the age of 9. I began taking my toys apart without being able to reassemble them far earlier than that, though. Enough of the rambling. Since I was 9, creating things has been a real hobby of mine. I wanted an awesome rabbit hunting car... I built one. For less than $600 no less. I wanted awesome target stands for my days on the shooting range (in the open desert)... I built those. I wanted everything in the house, or really I should say my wife did, so I built all that. 

Along the way, I wanted my building hobby to be cleaner, to be stronger. I've got a need for what I'm doing to be the best. It is rough, I often feel I'm in over my head when I begin, but I have to do it the hard way. Mortise and tenons, dovetails, half laps and bridal joints all stand out to me as some of the best ways to join wood together, for the strongest and longest lasting joints. So, that's what I do. That's what you'll get from me. 

Tekton is a small business, and my drive to achieve greater efficiency and service a larger customer base are the only two things I have to grow. There are several businesses in the area that lose clients as soon as they get them, because they do subpar work. But, they got paid, so they're on to the next one and have forgotten about you. That's not me, that's not Tekton. I'd prefer if I were your "I need this built, send me an invoice when it's done" guy. I'd prefer to get to know you to some degree, and make your wood working dreams come to life. 

Your home is one of your most serene places here on Earth, or at least that's the goal. We're steadily working toward that in the Schmidt house, but man it requires time because I am busy. Hopefully, I'm busy making it that way for you.
