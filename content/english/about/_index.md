Jake is a new father to a young son, a husband to Tektons co-owner Mikal, and otherwise a reasonably good guy. I've got 12 chickens and live in Jacksonville, Florida. I decided to start my own business because I love to build. Imagine that? The guy you're looking to hire to build, wanted to build his own _thing_. I got into the trade because I have a tendency to want to do things myself. I'm not sure what drives it, but man do I want to know how to do it myself. 

Along the way, I wanted my building hobby to be cleaner, to be stronger. I have a perfectionists desire for what I'm doing to be the best. It is rough, and I often feel I'm in over my head when I begin, but I have to do it the hard way. Mortise and tenons, dovetails, half laps and bridal joints all stand out to me as some of the best ways to join wood together, for the strongest and longest lasting joints. So, that's what I do. That's what you'll get from me. 

Tekton is a small business, and my drive to achieve greater efficiency and service a larger customer base are the only two things I have to grow. The business model to lose clients as soon as you get them due to subpar work isn't my style. They get paid, so they're on to the next one and have forgotten about you. That's not me, that's not Tekton. I'd prefer if Tekton were your "I need this built, send me an invoice when it's done". Of course, that doesn't happen over night. I'd prefer to get to know you, and make your wood working dreams come to life. 

Your home is one of your most precious places here on Earth, or at least that's the goal. We're steadily working toward that in the Schmidt house, but man it's tough because I am busy. Hopefully, I'm busy making it that way for you.
